                    <h3> What Does a GIS Specialist Do? </h3> <br> <br> 
                    <p class="1"> A Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Specialist designs, develops, and implements systems and databases to access and store geospatial data.
                    <br> <br>
                    GIS specialists design digital maps using geospatial data and analyze spatial and non-spatial information. It is common for GIS specialists to design maps for internal use (corporations and governments) or to create mobile and online applications.  
                    <br> <br>
                     GIS specialists commonly make assessments and recommendations to support engineering and construction business units. Itâ€™s important for people in this field to have exceptional problem-solving and analytical skills. By analyzing and visualizing geographic data in an easy-to-understand and actionable way, GIS specialists enable organizations and individuals to make more informed decisions.
