            <h2> Why should one consider a career in GIS? </h2>
            <p> Organizations across the globe are increasingly relying on location intelligence to make better decisions. As a result, careers in GIS are in demand more than ever. Equipped with data visualization and spatial analysis skills, GIS professionals qualify for occupations in countless fields. </p>

                <h2> What is the Future of GIS? </h2>
                <p>
                    
                    The growing need to collect, visualize analyse spatial data is the biggest driver behind the phenomenal growth of GIS in the coming years. Governments and businesses worldwide will increasingly use GIS to map and analyse geographical data and provide user-friendly information for better management of their resources and services. 
                    <br> <br>
                    What is also noteworthy is that with growing number of data sources, homogeneity is an important consideration. By combining the power of GIS with spatial data viewers such as Ellipsis Drive, a unified and consistent visualization can be achieved.
                    <br> <br>
                    This makes GIS indispensable for many industries, namely, civil engineering, land surveying, hydrology, environmental engineering, urban planning, crop management, archaeology, cartography, geomatics, and many other disciplines.
